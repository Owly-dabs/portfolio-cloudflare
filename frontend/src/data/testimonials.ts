    name: "Ben Reeves",
    position: "Director of AI at Metabob Inc",
    content: `I worked with Darryl during his 3-month internship with us at Metabob in San Francisco. His programming skill was excellent, and he has strong technical knowledge of AI and machine learning. 
    
    Startup companies can be at times chaotic; he took initiative and worked hands-on with several projects involving Large Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Postgres as a vector database. He dealt successfully with memory and speed issues.
    
    He was a productive member of our team, always motivated and creative. We all found him enjoyable to work with. I would strongly recommend him to any team looking for a motivated, knowledgeable, and capable intern or Engineer.`,

    name: "Oka Kurniawan",
    position: "Senior Lecturer at Singapore University of Technology and Design",
    content: `I have known Darryl since the year 2022. I was the subject lead for one of his courses in his Term 3 last year and I have worked with him as well on one of the workshops he conducted on “How to Learn”. With this letter, I want to give my strong recommendation for Darryl, knowing his character, capabilities and his passionate interest.
    
    I first knew Darryl through one of our alumnus over lunch. During our conversation, I found Darryl to be fascinating. He has a keen interest and knowledge in algorithms as a first year student. I could see at that time his capacity to self-learn many of these things on his own.

    I also happened to be a subject lead for one of his courses that he took in his Term 3 on computing. Darryl scored the top in this course and obtained A+ across all the three hundred plus students taking the course. This shows without doubt on his academic capabilities and performance.`,
